## Objectives
- **Destroy towers** to open the lane and eventually reach the enemy base.
- **Farm minions** for gold/XP and to push your lane.
- **Secure kills** to gain an advantage and deny the enemy map control.

---

## Game Setup (3v5)
- You play **1 hero** on the **Blue** team.
- You get **2 allied bots**.
- You fight **3 enemy bots**.

---

## Economy & Progression
- **Levels** increase your stats and unlock/upgrade abilities.
- **Last-hitting** minions is the safest way to scale up.
- **Don’t over-chase**: missing minion waves often costs more than a risky kill attempt.

---

## Combat Tips
- **Positioning wins fights**: stay at the edge of your attack range when possible.
- **Watch your HP threshold**: if you’re low, retreat and reset.
- **Team fights**: focus the nearest high-value target you can safely damage.
- **Engage / Disengage**: if your cooldowns are down, back off until they return.

---

## Abilities & Combos
- Abilities have different purposes:
  - **Engage**: close the gap and start fights.
  - **CC**: stun/slow to prevent escapes.
  - **Burst**: finish low-health enemies quickly.
  - **Sustain**: heal/shield to stay in combat.
  - **Escape / Mobility**: reposition or flee when in danger.
- Try simple combos like:
  - **Engage → CC → Burst**
  - **Poke with Q/E → Back off → Re-engage when cooldowns return**

---

## Map Layout
- **Top / Mid / Bot lanes** connect the two bases.
- **Jungle** contains neutral monsters for extra XP and pressure.
- **Towers** protect lanes and punish unsafe dives.
- **Fog of war**: you don’t always see enemies—play carefully when opponents are missing.

---

## Difficulty Settings
- **Easy**: slower reactions, fewer skill casts.
- **Normal**: balanced decision-making and ability usage.
- **Hard**: aggressive, uses CC/burst more reliably.
- **Nightmare**: very fast decisions and highly optimized skill usage.

---

## Tips & Tricks
- **Farm first, fight second**: consistent gold/XP wins long games.
- **Keep your escape ready** before you push deep.
- **Use Flash** to dodge lethal damage or reposition for a kill.
- **Don’t fight under enemy towers** unless you’re sure you can win quickly.

---

## Hero Roles (Quick Guide)
- **Tank**: frontline, absorbs damage, sets up fights with CC.
- **Damage / Marksman**: sustained damage from range; position carefully.
- **Mage**: burst damage and CC; cooldown management matters.
- **Assassin**: picks off low-health targets; thrives on mobility.
- **Support**: protects allies, provides CC/healing/shields.
